# DIA-Umpire GUI
This is a very basic GUI wrapper for DIA-Umpire in Java.  
It will help you run DIA-Umpire itself, as well as a Comet search and PeptideProphet afterwards.


## Running
`java -jar DIA-Umpire-GUI.jar`  
or on Windows  
`start javaw -jar DIA-Umpire-GUI.jar`  

## To build
The simplest way to build is to load the project in Intellij IDEA IDE and run `Build->Rebuild Artifacts`
